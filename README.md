# Time Tracking & Reporting System (NDA Project)

**Note:** This is a portfolio overview of a commercial project developed under NDA. The source code is not publicly available.

## üìå Project Overview

**Epoca** is a professional web-based system for tracking, managing, and reporting working hours. It was designed to help teams and managers monitor time allocation across projects, analyze productivity, and generate insightful reports for internal and external stakeholders.

This project was developed for a corporate client in a B2B setting.

## üë®‚Äçüíª My Role

I worked as the **sole frontend developer** on this project for approximately 6 months. My responsibilities included:

- Designing the architecture of the frontend from scratch using **React 18 + TypeScript**
- Creating a dynamic UI for tracking and editing time entries
- Implementing **state management** with MobX
- Integrating the app with backend services via **Axios (REST API)**
- Managing translations and internationalization with **i18next**
- Setting up **form validation** using Zod
- Adding **animations and UI transitions** with Framer Motion
- Developing reusable UI components with attention to accessibility and performance
- Writing **unit and e2e tests** using Testing Library and Playwright
- Maintaining a consistent and clean codebase using **ESLint, Prettier, and Husky hooks**
- **Working without a complete design specification** ‚Äì many UI/UX decisions were made independently based on direct user testing and feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **MobX** (state management)
- **SASS** (styling)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **Zod** (form validation)
- **React Router DOM** (routing)
- **i18next** (internationalization)

### Tooling & Dev Experience
- **ESLint + Prettier + Husky**
- **Playwright**, **React Testing Library**
- **Yarn 4 (Berry)**
- **SVGO** (SVG optimization)
- **Prettier-plugin-sort-imports**

### Notable Libraries
- `@dnd-kit` ‚Äì for implementing intuitive drag & drop UI
- `clsx`, `lodash`, `uuid`, `qs`

## üß† Key Challenges & Solutions

- **Customizable time-entry forms:** Implemented flexible UI components capable of handling varying input patterns and validation rules using Zod.
- **Optimized rendering:** Improved performance on complex table views with MobX observables and memoization.
- **Multi-language support:** Integrated `i18next` with ICU message formatting for dynamic content translation.
- **Clean code practices:** Enforced code consistency with auto-formatting and import sorting.

## üöÄ Outcome

- The frontend was successfully integrated into the client's ecosystem and rolled out internally.
- Provided a fully responsive and accessible UI, designed for ease of use across multiple roles (employees, managers, and HR staff).
- Maintained high test coverage and developer ergonomics, enabling smooth future handover.
